						<h2>8 Top UX Design trends</h2>

		<p>In the beginning there was Donald A. Norman, and he created the idea of user experience design.I invented the term because I thought human interface and usability were too narrow. I wanted to cover all aspects of the person’s experience with the system including industrial design graphics, the interface, the physical interaction and the manual. Since then the term has spread widely, so much so that it is starting to lose its meaning.<br>
		— Donald Norman<br>
		By 2016, Don Norman was pretty vocal about how badly misunderstood the term had become. He talks about it in this short YouTube video. These days he says he’s a people designer (apologies, I’ve misplaced the interview link), sort of, but he’s non-committal about the title.
		I can’t think of a better place to start unraveling the weird and confusing world of modern UX Design than this: Not even the originator of our field knows what to call himself anymore.
		De-obfuscating modern UX requires understanding the history of both design and development since the 1990s. They’re intrinsically linked, so it helps to start just a few years after it all began.</p>

					<p>Classic User Experience Design
		In its purest form, UX Design is waterfall based.
		A product team working through the waterfall methodology sets out to learn everything they possibly can before building even the simplest prototype. Research can take months, or even years to complete; and the results dictate a design team’s execution. The requirements lock before design kicks off, and design locks before development kicks off. There’s no going back, not until version 2.0. That’s just how waterfall operates. A classic UX process is usually taught to college students. It goes like this: Do research to discover what the problem is
		Categorize the problems you uncover Create personas and journey maps
		Run ideation exercises to generate ideas Build and test a prototype. Send the final prototype out the door to development Launch the product. Return to step 1 based on user feedback That’s basically a waterfall. The classic elements of UX (Jesse James Garrett) also follow a waterfall schema, building an execution from the bottom up based on well articulated requirements.  </p>
